# Guidelines for Reviewing a Talk Proposal


### Main Goals:

- The goal of a talk proposal should focus on **scientific computing**.

- The work or ideas that the speaker presents should make use of or promote **open source software**. This can be Python-based, but can also be other open source softwares or tools.

---

### How to evaluate suitability:

- **Relevance**: Is the topic clearly relevant to scientific computing and open-source tools? And does it introduce useful methods, libraries, or case studies?

- Value to the audience level: Is the topic at an **appropriate level** (beginner, intermediate, advanced) for the audience?

### Review Process:

- Go through abstract, description, slides, and other materials provided by the speaker.

- If slides are not provided, **encourage the speaker to provide finished or tentative slides** before the talk.

- Consider technical details, clarity of presentation, and audience appropriateness.

- Where appropriate, aim to **help speakers improve their proposals**. Offer clear, actionable feedback where the proposal can be strengthened or clarified. This is especially useful for first time speakers new to the Python community/ecosystem.
    
    - Suggest how to clarify preseantation goals, improve flow, or highlight the most valuable content.

    - Help them tailor the talk better to your audience's background and interests.

    - Encourage addition of code snippets, wherever possible.
    
    - Encourage the speaker to talk about why they chose to use the software they're using, what might they have done better in hindsight, any help they may want from (or give to) the community with regards to their project and tools.
    
    - Encourage iteration and offer to review a revised proposal or updated slides. If possible, be willing to mentor or pair them with someone who can help if needed.

- Follow-up and communicate decisions kindly and transparently
    
    - Explain reasons for acceptance, rejection, or requested revisions.
    
    - Encourage future submissions from all speakers, even if they are not accepted this time.

---

### Other important points:

- **Diversity** of voices: encourage participation from new speakers and from traditionaly underrepresented voices in STEM.

- Be aware of and try to **avoid any bias** while reviewing proposals.

- Avoid giving the same speaker too many slots.
